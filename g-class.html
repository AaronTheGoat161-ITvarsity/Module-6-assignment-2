                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                        The <em>Silver Mercedes G-Class</em>, often referred to as the <em>G-Wagon</em>, is a symbol of rugged luxury and unparalleled off-road prowess. 
                        With its iconic boxy design and a modern twist of refinement, the G-Class stands out on both city streets and rough terrains. The sleek <em>silver exterior</em> gives it a sophisticated edge, while its powerful build maintains its off-road legacy.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Performance and Features</h3>
                        <p>
                        Under the hood, the G-Class is powered by a <em>4.0L twin-turbocharged V8 engine</em> that delivers up to <em>577 horsepower</em> in the G63 AMG model. 
                        This allows it to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just <em>4.5 seconds</em>, a remarkable feat for such a large SUV. The G-Class is equipped with a <em>9-speed automatic transmission</em> and offers multiple off-road driving modes, making it just as capable in the wilderness as it is on the highway.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Inside, the G-Class is nothing short of luxurious. Premium leather seating, ambient lighting, and a cutting-edge infotainment system ensure a first-class experience. 
                        With advanced tech features and a spacious interior, it combines <em>comfort</em> and <em>utility</em>, perfect for both urban and off-road adventures.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Market Price</h3>
                        <p>
                        The <em>market price</em> for a <em>Silver Mercedes G-Class</em> typically starts at around <b>$130,000</b> for the base model in the <em>United States</em>, but prices can climb higher for the <em>AMG G63</em> and fully customized versions. 
                        In <em>South Africa</em>, prices range from approximately <b>R3 million</b> to <b>R4 million</b>, depending on the model and optional features.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The G-Class continues to be a favorite among celebrities and adventurers alike, combining <em>luxury</em>, <em>performance</em>, and the iconic rugged design that has made it a standout in the SUV market.
