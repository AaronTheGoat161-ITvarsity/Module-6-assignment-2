                        Built for pure driving excitement, this car is designed for those who appreciate a balance of style, performance, and exclusivity.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Performance and Features</h3>

                        While the power may seem modest, the 4C’s lightweight carbon-fiber monocoque chassis allows it to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just <em>4.1 seconds</em>, with a top speed of <em>258 km/h</em>. 
                        The car is equipped with a <em>6-speed dual-clutch transmission</em>, ensuring lightning-fast gear changes and delivering a truly responsive driving experience.

                        <p>
                        Inside, the 4C is all about the driver. The minimalist cockpit focuses on performance, with exposed carbon fiber and racing-inspired seats. 
                        While it forgoes some of the luxury features found in other sports cars, it makes up for it with its lightweight and race-ready feel. 
                        It’s a car built for those who crave a pure connection between driver and machine.
